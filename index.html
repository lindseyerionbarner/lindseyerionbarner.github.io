I am a microscope builder and hardware developer with expertise in image processing and deep learning. I am looking to work in the <b> Boston, MA</b> area on cutting-edge research that will advance human health and patient care.

<br><br>

During my Ph.D. research at the University of Washington in the Molecular Biophotonics Laboratory, I developed the first multi-resolution open-top light-sheet microscope [1], enabled by
novel optics (patent pending) [2,3]. We have demonstrated the potential for this device and 3D imaging technique to improve breast cancer staging accuracy and patient management after surgery [4]. 
The final chapter of my thesis focused on developing artificial intelligence approaches to assist pathologists 
with diagnosing esophageal cancer and dysplasia using 3D pathology [5,6]. My latest conference poster may be viewed <a href= "https://lindseybarner.github.io/docs/Erion_Barner_UWMDS_poster.pdf">here.</a>

<br><br>
More recently, my latest research at Nanostring Technologies, Inc. focused on 3D spatial transcriptomics where I developed a light sheet microscope for imaging RNA 
assays and protein analytes in cleared tissues <i>in situ</i>.
